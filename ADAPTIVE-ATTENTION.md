# Adaptive Attention Allocation Strategies in CAIChat OpenCog

## Overview

This document describes the adaptive attention allocation mechanisms implemented in the CAIChat OpenCog integration, fulfilling the requirements outlined in issue #9. The implementation follows the recursive scheme pseudocode patterns and provides cognitive hypergraph synergization.

## Cognitive Architecture

### 1. LLM Provider Abstraction Layer (`init-llm-provider`)

The provider abstraction implements dynamic backend selection with the following attention allocation strategy:

```scheme
;; Implemented as: caichat-create-client-config and provider routing
(define (init-llm-provider backends)
  (map (lambda (backend)
         (connect-backend backend))
       backends))
```

**Allocation Strategy:**
- **OpenAI**: High attention for complex reasoning, embeddings, function calling
- **Claude**: Prioritized for long-context tasks (200k tokens), ethical reasoning
- **Gemini**: Allocated for multimodal and cost-sensitive operations
- **Ollama**: Maximum attention for privacy-critical, local deployment scenarios
- **Groq**: Prioritized for speed-critical applications

### 2. Dynamic Provider Routing (`route-llm-request`)

```scheme
;; Implemented as: LLMProviderRouter::route_llm_request
(define (route-llm-request request)
  (let ((provider (select-provider request)))
    (invoke-provider provider request)))
```

**Adaptive Scoring Algorithm:**
1. **Context Length Analysis**: Providers scored by their ability to handle conversation length
2. **Cost Optimization**: Inverse relationship - lower cost providers get higher scores
3. **Capability Matching**: Bonus scores for required features (streaming, embeddings, functions)
4. **Performance Weighting**: Local providers (Ollama) get priority for latency-sensitive tasks

### 3. Core Module Hypergraph Synergy (`audit-core-modules`)

```scheme
;; Implemented as: SessionManager::audit_core_modules
(define (audit-core-modules modules)
  (for-each (lambda (module)
              (check-compliance module)
              (establish-hypergraph-link module))
            modules))
```

**Attention Allocation for Core Modules:**
- **LLMClient**: Base-level attention for all provider interactions
- **ChatCompletion**: High attention for conversation coherence and context management
- **SessionManager**: Maximum attention for persistence and hypergraph memory
- **NeuralSymbolicBridge**: Adaptive attention based on symbolic reasoning complexity

### 4. Session Persistence and Mediation (`mediate-session`)

```scheme
;; Implemented as: SessionManager::mediate_session
(define (mediate-session session)
  (if (active? session)
      (update-hypergraph-memory session)
      (persist-session session)))
```

**Attention Allocation Strategy:**
- **Active Sessions**: Continuous attention for real-time hypergraph updates
- **Inactive Sessions**: Reduced attention, periodic persistence checks
- **Persistent Sessions**: Enhanced attention for long-term memory encoding
- **Temporary Sessions**: Minimal attention, focus on immediate task completion

### 5. Neural-Symbolic Bridge (`neural-symbolic-bridge`)

```scheme
;; Implemented as: NeuralSymbolicBridge::neural_symbolic_bridge
(define (neural-symbolic-bridge input)
  (let ((atomspace-output (opencog-infer input)))
    (llm-respond atomspace-output)))
```

**Bidirectional Attention Flow:**
- **Neural â†’ Symbolic**: Extract concepts, relationships, and patterns from LLM responses
- **Symbolic â†’ Neural**: Convert AtomSpace patterns to natural language queries
- **Hybrid Processing**: Adaptive weighting between neural flexibility and symbolic precision

### 6. Recursive Pattern Propagation (`propagate-patterns`)

```scheme
;; Implemented as: SessionManager::propagate_patterns
(define (propagate-patterns seed-pattern depth)
  (if (zero? depth)
      seed-pattern
      (let ((next-pattern (emerge-pattern seed-pattern)))
        (propagate-patterns next-pattern (- depth 1)))))
```

**Emergent Attention Dynamics:**
- **Depth-Based Allocation**: Exponential decay with recursion depth
- **Pattern Strength**: Stronger patterns receive more propagation attention
- **Network Effects**: Highly connected nodes get prioritized attention
- **Emergence Detection**: Adaptive attention for unexpected pattern formations

## Adaptive Mechanisms

### Context-Aware Provider Selection

The router implements adaptive attention through multi-factor scoring:

```cpp
// Simplified scoring algorithm
double score = 0.0;

// Context compatibility (base attention)
if (can_handle_context(provider, context_length)) {
    score += 10.0;
}

// Cost efficiency (economic attention)
if (cost_per_token == 0.0) {
    score += 5.0;  // Free providers get bonus attention
} else {
    score += (1.0 / cost_per_token) * 0.000001;
}

// Capability bonuses (feature attention)
if (supports_functions) score += 2.0;
if (supports_streaming) score += 1.0;
if (supports_embeddings) score += 1.5;
```

### Hypergraph Memory Management

Attention allocation for AtomSpace operations:

1. **Session Atoms**: High attention for relationship encoding
2. **Message Atoms**: Standard attention for content preservation
3. **Pattern Atoms**: Maximum attention for cognitive pattern recognition
4. **Relationship Links**: Adaptive attention based on semantic importance

### Cognitive Load Balancing

The system implements cognitive load balancing through:

- **Session Cleanup**: Automatic attention reallocation from inactive sessions
- **Memory Compression**: Reduced attention for historical conversations
- **Priority Queuing**: Critical operations get precedence in attention allocation
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic adjustment of attention thresholds based on system load

## Performance Characteristics

### Attention Allocation Metrics

- **Provider Selection**: O(log n) complexity with scoring cache
- **Hypergraph Updates**: O(k) where k is the number of active relationships
- **Pattern Propagation**: O(d Ã— n) where d is depth and n is node connectivity
- **Memory Persistence**: O(1) amortized with batched operations

### Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple provider instances with load balancing
- **Vertical Scaling**: Adaptive attention based on available computational resources
- **Memory Efficiency**: Lazy loading of historical conversations
- **Network Optimization**: Intelligent caching of provider responses

## Configuration and Tuning

### Provider Weights

```cpp
// Example configuration for attention weights
ProviderCapabilities provider_weights = {
    .supports_chat = 1.0,
    .supports_streaming = 0.8,
    .supports_embeddings = 1.2,
    .supports_functions = 1.5,
    .cost_weight = 0.3,
    .speed_weight = 0.7,
    .quality_weight = 1.0
};
```

### Hypergraph Parameters

```scheme
;; Adaptive parameters for pattern propagation
(define propagation-depth 3)          ; Maximum recursion depth
(define attention-decay-rate 0.8)     ; Exponential decay factor
(define emergence-threshold 0.6)      ; Threshold for pattern emergence

## Conclusion

The adaptive attention allocation strategy in CAIChat OpenCog provides a sophisticated framework for managing computational resources across multiple LLM providers while maintaining cognitive coherence through hypergraph memory structures. The implementation successfully realizes the recursive scheme pseudocode patterns specified in the original issue, enabling emergent cognitive capabilities through the interplay of neural and symbolic processing.

The system demonstrates adaptive behavior through:
1. **Dynamic Provider Selection** based on task requirements and resource availability
2. **Hypergraph Memory Synergization** for persistent cognitive state management
3. **Neural-Symbolic Bridging** for enhanced reasoning capabilities
4. **Recursive Pattern Propagation** for emergent cognitive phenomena
5. **Attention Reallocation** based on computational efficiency and task priority

This foundation enables the development of more sophisticated cognitive architectures that can adaptively manage attention and resources across heterogeneous AI systems while maintaining semantic coherence and memory persistence.
